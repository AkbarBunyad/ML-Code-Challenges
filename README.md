This repository is designed with the principle that if you can build an algorithm from scratch, you truly understand the underlying concept. To that end, it provides scratch implementations of a wide variety of algorithms commonly used in machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, and sometimes statistics.

The repository is structured into two main sections:

Problem Solutions: Contains solutions to problems sourced from the [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/) platform, where LeetCode-style challenges in machine learning and deep learning are solved. Each solution is implemented from scratch to solidify understanding of each concept.
General Concepts: Covers fundamental concepts that extend beyond specific challenges on Deep-ML. This section includes algorithmic examples and explanations that provide a solid foundation in machine learning and deep learning topics.
